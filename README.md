# Content Extractor with Vision LLM

This repository contains a Python project that extracts text and images from various file types (PDF, DOCX, PPTX), describes the images using the `llama3.2-vision` model, and saves the results in a specified output directory.

## TODO
- Delete extracted images after processing.
- Implement a module to extract tabular data from documents and transform it into a narrative format for more meaningful LLM consumption.

## Features

- Extract text and images from PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files
- Describe images using the `llama3.2-vision` model
- Save extracted text and image descriptions in a specified output directory
- User-friendly command-line interface for specifying input and output folders
- Modular and extensible code structure following SOLID principles
- Compare image descriptions generated by different models

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Poetry
- Ollama

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Poetry**

   If you haven't installed Poetry yet, you can do so by following the instructions on the [Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

3. **Install Project Dependencies**

   Use Poetry to install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

## Setup Ollama

1. **Run Ollama Server**

   Start the Ollama server by running:

   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

2. **Pull the `llama3.2-vision` Model**

   Pull the required model by executing:

   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2-vision
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Main Script**

   Execute the main script using Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry run python main.py
   ```

2. **Provide Input**

   When prompted, enter the following information:
   - Source folder path (default: `./content/source`)
   - Output folder path (default: `./content/extracted`)
   - File type to process (pdf, docx, or pptx)

   The script will process the specified file type from the source folder and save the extracted text and image descriptions in the output folder.

## Using a Remote Ollama host

For scenarios where you might not have enough capcity to run a given model, it is possible to run this project locally while using an external Ollama server. Initialize the `OLLAMA_HOST` environmental variable to instruct the system to use an externally exposed Ollama API.

```bash
export OLLAMA_HOST='100.50.24.12'
```

Only define the IP address, the system assumes the API is rudementary exposed using HTTP and on the default port `11434`.cd

## Compare Image Descriptions

The `describe_image_compare.py` script allows you to compare image descriptions generated by different models. It takes an image path as input and sends the image to multiple specified models to obtain their respective descriptions. The script then saves the results in a CSV file for easy comparison.

### Usage

1. Update the `image_path` variable in the `describe_image_compare.py` script with the path to the image you want to compare descriptions for.

2. Modify the `models` list in the script to include the models you want to compare. The available models are: "llava", "llava:34b", and "llama3.2-vision".

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   poetry run python describe_image_compare.py
   ```

4. The script will process the image with each specified model and save the results in a CSV file. The default output path is `/Users/roland/image_descriptions.csv`. You can change this by updating the `output_csv` variable in the script.

The generated CSV file will have two columns: "model" and "description". Each row represents the description generated by a specific model for the given image.

## Project Structure

- `extract_pptx.py`: Module for extracting text and images from PPTX files.
- `describe_image.py`: Module for describing images using the `llama3.2-vision` model.
- `describe_image_compare.py`: Script for comparing image descriptions generated by different models.
- `pyproject.toml`: Poetry configuration file specifying project dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: File specifying patterns for files and directories to be ignored by Git.
